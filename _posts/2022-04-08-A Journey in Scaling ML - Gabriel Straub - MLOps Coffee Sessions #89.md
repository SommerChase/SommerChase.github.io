I highly recommend readers and viewers (and listeners when they get home) to watch this *quick* introduction video to what Ocado Technology does. It really changes the way you view this interview when you see 1000s of robots running simultaneously!

### Machine Learning (ML) Governance is Easier on Proven ML Architectures & Methods (Golden Path)

1. **Timestamp:** 20:00 - 20:32
2. **YouTube Clip:** [https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx_Xe232O2hqdzi40D4m1N-LRwAkx-2xEa](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx_Xe232O2hqdzi40D4m1N-LRwAkx-2xEa)
3. **Summary:** When answering about a "Golden Path" in machine learning system architecture, Gabriel added that an additional benefit of using battle-tested ML architectures and methods is that they're also easier to explain.
4. **Thoughts:** The topic of ML governance will continue to grow as more of the general public and lawmakers begin to understand machine learning at a deeper level. The degree of governance will vary by topic - a self-driving car that is able to take a life will require many layers of governance compared to a model that recommends soap on Amazon.

### Machine Learning (ML) is the Input, Not the Outcome

1. **Timestamp:** 26:36 - 26:54
2. **YouTube Clip:** [https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxVCbDkxgNykvAeEdw_V9MaZOjrLRSZ1lk](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxVCbDkxgNykvAeEdw_V9MaZOjrLRSZ1lk)
3. **Summary:** When defining metrics of a successful machine learning project, Gabriel takes a step back and mentions that a successful machine learning project depends on the value you bring to the user or business, not specific ML metrics.
4. **Thoughts:** This perspective requires a mature machine learning practitioner because noobs like me want to implement machine learning in everything. A seasoned developer knows that there‚Äôs a time and place for everything.

### The Importance of All Users Understanding the Impact of Their Choices & Data

1. **Timestamp:** 29:13 - 30:18
2. **YouTube Clip:** [https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxuKslyP48VTaEI6gfyGp8Z_MMlKBo3QB4](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxuKslyP48VTaEI6gfyGp8Z_MMlKBo3QB4) (Doesn‚Äôt capture full length since YouTube clips are max one minute.)
3. **Summary:** Gabriel points out the fact that we are in an age where all employees produce data with their actions. Some employees affect direct inputs to machine learning models and may not even realize it.
4. **Thoughts:** Although I‚Äôm sure some companies teach their employees about how their inputs seriously affect models; I‚Äôd bet that most don‚Äôt. This is quite interesting to think about because in the future all employees, whether a line worker at a meat-packing factory or a sales rep in corporate, will need to understand that everything they do affect the company's models. Also, companies will need to safeguard against employees who know they can mess up models and cause serious harm on purpose.

### Simple Rule-Based Architecture is a Good Baseline for Machine Learning, So Start There First.

1. **Timestamp:** 38:04 - 38:55
2. **YouTube Clip:** [https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxYCccRSkv1zlKeJ7ecWLRdVraE3Qw0OUa](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxYCccRSkv1zlKeJ7ecWLRdVraE3Qw0OUa)
3. **Summary:** When asked if Gabriel agrees with the sentiment of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use machine learning for everything,‚Äù Gabriel agrees to a certain degree. He doesn‚Äôt think you shouldn‚Äôt use machine learning for everything, but that you should start with rule-based architecture that‚Äôs open for machine learning updates later on. By doing this, you now have a baseline metric (rule-based system) to compare the results of your new ML update in the future. 
4. **Thoughts:** This is a refreshing mindset that recognizes people should aspire to implement machine learning effectively, but also recognizes that it‚Äôs hard. Starting simple may not be as cool or resume-padding, but it serves as a good foundation. 

### Part 1/2: Do Not Make Business Users Feel Dumb When Building Smart Applications with Machine Learning

1. **Timestamp:** 47:18 - 48:16
2. **YouTube Clip:** [https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxnegymnHJ1UMQZ63P-nEZ46llGLbW-xpQ](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxnegymnHJ1UMQZ63P-nEZ46llGLbW-xpQ)

### Part 2/2: Make Business Users Feel Empowered When Building Applications with Machine Learning

1. **Timestamp**: 48:16 - 49:14
2. **YouTube Clip:** [https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxo1bWwVfoA4F98WrpE9INVhGpvTyb855n](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxo1bWwVfoA4F98WrpE9INVhGpvTyb855n)

1. **Summary:** Gabriel tells two stories about sharing machine learning tools with business units and whether or not they adopted the tool. For the first encounter, his team shared the tool and told them how smart it was and how complex the machine learning within it is. These users felt intimidated and as though they were being replaced by a tool. For the other encounter, his team focused on how this tool would help the business users do their job better and faster - relieving a lot of manual labor and headache. Although this was the same tool, Gabriel‚Äôs team did not focus on the machine learning part, but the value-added part. The second business unit adopted the tool!
2. **Thoughts:** A topic that is usually paired with technology and AI is the fear that people will lose their jobs to a robot. When trying to get buy-in from stakeholders, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to describe the tool in a way that feeds that fear. Instead, explain how it empowers them and makes them look and perform better. Building an amazing machine learning application is worthless if no one uses it!
