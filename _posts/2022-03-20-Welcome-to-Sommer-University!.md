Welcome to Sommer University!

Those that know me know that I’m not a fan of universities for all people, but at the same time know that I am always learning and pushing to be a better version of myself. To iterate, no, I don’t think most people should go to a 4-year university. I think it is so freaking overrated for people not going into fields like finance, engineering, math (in general STEM classes). On the other hand, I think it’s essential to constantly learn and push yourself. Hence, Sommer University - my own learning regimen that I’d love to share with everyone else.

I’m currently a Business Analyst (shout-out to [Cree LED](https://cree-led.com/)) enrolled in the machine learning degree with aspirations to work with the coolest people in AI. If I could do that in the gaming industry I’ll be living the dream. The current syllabus is:



* DataCamp: 7-10 hours a week doing the [Data Scientist with Python track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5) (88 hours total)
    * Data Analyst with SQL Server (41 hours total)
    * Data Engineer with Python (73 hours total)
    * Machine Learning Scientist with Python (93 hours total)
* Feedly: Ad Hoc Reading 
* Personal Project: TeamFight Tactics (on weekends)
    * Doing just-in-time learning in Python.
* This Blog
    * Inspired by [Eugene Yan’s](https://eugeneyan.com/speaking/writing-for-a-tech-career/) talk on the importance of writing in a tech career, I’m starting this blog to help me learn and find others who are interested in similar things. Reach out to me if you want to chat!

One thing I want to make clear is that I firmly believe I will achieve all my goals in the future. I also believe that Jesus will be [guiding ](https://biblehub.com/niv/proverbs/16.htm)me along the way. [Generosity](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-27.htm) is a legacy I want to leave behind for my family, friends, and community. Anyways, stay tuned for tech, career, and life related posts.
